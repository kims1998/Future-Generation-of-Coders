Horiseon, more simplified

Within the project, the main objective was to keep the web page looking the same. However the html and css style needed to be "cleansed."

Inside the Index.html:

    * Many changes were made in order for the lines to be readable.
      For example, in the event that the user opened the inspect element, they would see that when they hover over the pictures, body, heading, links, everything would
      show "Div." They would not understand what they're hovering over. In this case, I had changed the semantics to be more descriptive of what is being hovered over.

    * The "Search Engine Optimization" button in the header did not go anywhere when pressed compared to its counterparts. In this case, I gave the button a location to
      travel to.

    * In the title, there was no "title". In this case I created a generic title that would appear if a user were to google or bing the Horiseon webpage.

    * In the event that the pictures were to not load, I had included an alt attribute as a contingency. This allows the user to understand what would've been displayed.

Inside the Style.css:

    * I noticed that there were repeating values. In this case, to minimize the amount of lines, I combined each class and gave it the same value instead of separately.
